# Volcanoids Questing Update
Heyo! I was given an interesting task by Tomas a while ago and decided that instead of just writing him a tree, I would write the functions from the tech tree and the questing line into the game itself.
This Magical mod is what actually will have those features. Reguardless as to if the team uses them, I will have them put up here so anyone can enjoy what this game update could have to offer.

Please read the [FEATURES.md](https://github.com/MelodicAlbuild/QuestingUpdate/blob/master/QuestingUpdate/Information/FEATURES.md) for the Features of the Mod and [Questing Releases](https://github.com/MelodicAlbuild/QuestingUpdate/releases) for Updates.

Any feedback on the mod is welcome and honestly I would really appreciate it! I'll have ways to contact me below!
Having Issues with the Mod? Open up an issue! I'm happy to help!
Got a magical idea for this mod or this update? Maybe your artsey like I am not and can make some awesome icons for this stuff? Open a pull request! I look at them all!
